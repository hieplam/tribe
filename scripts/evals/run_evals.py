"""Repo-level eval runner for the tribe repo.

Executes an `evals/evals.json` file (the shape every fixture in this repo uses:
skill_name, evals[].id/name/prompt/expected_output/files)
against isolated `claude -p` subprocesses — one clean-context process per case per
configuration, mirroring the official skill-creator eval loop's own runner
(`skill-creator/scripts/run_eval.py` spawns one `claude -p` per query rather than
reusing a session) instead of inventing a new mechanism.

For every case, up to two configurations are run:

  with_skill     the skill/agent under test is made available for this invocation
                 only, and nothing else installed at user scope on the host
                 machine leaks in:
                   - skill evals (kind: "skill") copy the ENTIRE real skill
                     directory (SKILL.md + references/, scripts/, assets — not
                     just the frontmatter `description:`) into the scratch
                     cwd's project scope under .claude/skills/<name>/, exactly
                     like skill-creator's own eval loop installs the skill
                     under test — so the skill can genuinely trigger (or fail
                     to) via the normal Skill tool and exercise its real body
                     (thresholds, phase names, round caps, references,
                     anti-patterns), not dead-end at a one-line stub.
                   - agent evals (kind: "agent", tribe) pass the named agent's
                     real frontmatter + body straight through `--agents` /
                     `--agent`, independent of whether it happens to be
                     symlink-installed locally — the eval targets the agent
                     definition in this repo, not the local install state.
                   - both call `claude -p` with `--setting-sources project
                     --strict-mcp-config` (never `--safe-mode`, which would
                     also suppress the throwaway command / --agents payload
                     this leg depends on). `--setting-sources project` loads
                     only the scratch cwd's own `.claude/` — i.e. the one
                     throwaway command we just wrote there — and excludes the
                     user-scope settings source entirely, so every other
                     locally-installed marketplace plugin/skill (this repo's
                     own tribe and verify-shipped plugins included, plus
                     anything else symlink-installed at user scope) is
                     invisible for this
                     run; `--strict-mcp-config` with no `--mcp-config` drops
                     every user-configured MCP server the same way. Verified
                     empirically: registering a throwaway command and running
                     `claude -p ... --setting-sources project
                     --strict-mcp-config` reports exactly the built-in
                     baseline slash_commands plus the one throwaway command
                     (`plugins: []`, `mcp_servers: []` in the `system`/`init`
                     event) — none of the other locally-installed marketplace
                     plugins appear, unlike an unflagged call which reports
                     all of them simultaneously.
  without_skill  a `claude -p --safe-mode` call — nothing registered AND all
                 user-level customizations (CLAUDE.md, skills, plugins, hooks,
                 MCP servers, custom commands/agents) disabled, so a skill
                 that also happens to be installed at user scope on the
                 machine running this harness (common when dogfooding this
                 repo's own marketplace) cannot silently fire and collapse
                 the baseline into the with_skill run. This is the baseline
                 a benchmark compares against.

Each run's transcript and the token/duration numbers `claude -p --output-format
stream-json --verbose` already reports (duration_ms, usage, total_cost_usd — no
separate instrumentation needed) are graded by a second, tool-less `claude -p`
call (the "grader"), scored against the case's expected_output. Results are written as
grading.json per run (schema: skill-creator's references/schemas.md
`grading.json`) and rolled up into one benchmark.json per invocation (schema:
skill-creator's `benchmark.json`, with_skill vs without_skill).

This script only reads skill/agent files and shells out to `claude -p` in a
scratch working directory — it never edits a skill's or agent's runtime files.

Usage:
    scripts/evals/run_evals.py --evals plugins/tribe/evals/evals.json
    scripts/evals/run_evals.py --evals plugins/tribe/evals/evals.json --eval-id 3,6
    scripts/evals/run_evals.py --all                      # every evals.json under plugins/
    scripts/evals/run_evals.py --all --mode with_skill     # skip the baseline, just prove it runs
    scripts/evals/run_evals.py --all --dry-run             # list what would run, no API calls
